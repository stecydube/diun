If the platform is not filled in, it will be deduced automatically from the information of your operating system on which Diun is running. In the example below, Diun is running ( diun_x.x.x_windows_i386.zip ) on Windows 10 and tries to analyze the crazymax/cloudflared image with the detected platform ( windows/386) : - name : crazymax/cloudflared:2020.2.1 But this platform is not supported by this image as you can see on DockerHub : Warning Fri, 27 Mar 2020 01:20:03 UTC WRN Cannot get remote manifest error=\"Cannot create image closer: Error choosing image instance: no image found in manifest list for architecture 386, variant \\\"\\\", OS windows\" image=docker.io/image=crazymax/cloudflared:2020.2.1 provider=file You have to force the platform for this image if you are not on a supported platform: - name : crazymax/cloudflared:2020.2.1 platform : os : linux arch : amd64 Success Fri, 27 Mar 2020 01:24:33 UTC INF New image found image=docker.io/crazymax/cloudflared:2020.2.1 provider=file Too many requests to registry \u00b6 The error Cannot create image closer: too many requests to registry is returned when the HTTP status code returned by the registry is 429. This can happen on the DockerHub registry because of the rate-limited anonymous pulls . To solve this you must first be authenticated against the registry through the regopts settings : regopts : - name : \"docker.io\" selector : image username : foo password : bar If this is not enough, tweak the schedule setting with something like 0 */6 * * * (every 6 hours). Docker Hub rate limits \u00b6 Docker is now enforcing Docker Hub pull rate limits . This means you can make 100 pull image requests per six hours for anonymous usage, and 200 pull image requests per six hours for free Docker accounts. But this rate limit is not necessarily an indicator on the number of times an image has actually been downloaded. In fact, their pulls counter/metric is actually a representation of the number of times a manifest for a particular image has been retrieved. As you probably know, Diun downloads the manifest of an image from its registry through a GET request to be able to retrieve its inside metadata. Fortunately Diun doesn't perform a GET request at each scan but only when an image has been updated or added on the registry. This allows us not to exceed this rate limit in our situation, but it also strongly depends on the number of images you scan . To increase your pull rate limits you can upgrade your account to a Docker Pro or Team subscription and authenticate against the registry through the regopts settings : regopts : - name : \"docker.io\" selector : image username : foo password : bar Or you can tweak the schedule setting with something like 0 */6 * * * (every 6 hours). Warning Also be careful with the watch_repo setting as it will fetch manifest for ALL tags available for the image. Tags sorting when using watch_repo \u00b6 When you use the watch_repo setting, Diun will fetch all tags available for the image. Depending on the registry, order of the tags list can change.

This means you can make 100 pull image requests per six hours for anonymous usage, and 200 pull image requests per six hours for free Docker accounts. But this rate limit is not necessarily an indicator on the number of times an image has actually been downloaded. In fact, their pulls counter/metric is actually a representation of the number of times a manifest for a particular image has been retrieved. As you probably know, Diun downloads the manifest of an image from its registry through a GET request to be able to retrieve its inside metadata. Fortunately Diun doesn't perform a GET request at each scan but only when an image has been updated or added on the registry. This allows us not to exceed this rate limit in our situation, but it also strongly depends on the number of images you scan . To increase your pull rate limits you can upgrade your account to a Docker Pro or Team subscription and authenticate against the registry through the regopts settings : regopts : - name : \"docker.io\" selector : image username : foo password : bar Or you can tweak the schedule setting with something like 0 */6 * * * (every 6 hours).
